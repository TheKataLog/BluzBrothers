# ADR-005: Patient Registration Out of Scope

## Date:
2024-02-21

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
During the event storming session, a business need emerged for patient registration and linking sensors to patients. The decision is to keep this functionality outside the monitor me system's scope. The consequences are that the system under development must align with an existing solution. Additionally, a positive aspect is that there is no need to implement this within the project scope.

## Decision:
The decision is to exclude patient registration and sensor-patient linkage from the system scope.

## Consequences:
### Pros:
- Seamless alignment with an existing solution.
- Avoidance of implementing additional features within the project scope.

### Cons:
- The need for the system to adapt to an external solution.
