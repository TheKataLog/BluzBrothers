# ADR-11: Choosing the top 3 characteristics

## Date:
2024-02-21

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
The decision is needed to prioritize the three most crucial architectural characteristics for the "MonitorMe" project, a patient monitoring system.

## Decision:
Based on a diagram mapping characteristics to components, the decision is to identify Evolvability, Performance, and Elasticity as the top three architectural characteristics for the "MonitorMe" system.

## Consequences:
### Pros:
- The decision provides clarity by focusing on the three most significant architectural characteristics.
- It allows for a more targeted selection of the system architecture, aligning with the identified priorities.
- The chosen characteristics, Evolvability, Performance, and Elasticity, are likely to contribute to a flexible, high-performing, and scalable system.

### Cons:
- Prioritizing only three characteristics may overlook other important aspects of the system architecture.
- The decision relies on the accuracy of the mapping diagram, and any discrepancies could impact the effectiveness of the chosen characteristics.
- It may limit consideration of other potential architectural optimizations that could enhance the overall system.
