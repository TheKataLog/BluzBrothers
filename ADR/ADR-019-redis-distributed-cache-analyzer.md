# ADR-019: Implementing Redis as Distributed Cache for Analyzer Data Storage and Recovery

## Date:
2024-02-21

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
The decision is needed to address data storage and recovery concerns in the "MonitorMe" project, a patient monitoring system.

## Decision:
The decision is to implement a distributed cache, such as Redis, for the analyzer to store data. This is crucial to enable new instances to reconstruct rules based on the most recent data in case of issues with the existing analyzer instance.

## Consequences:
### Pros:
- The use of a distributed cache enhances data storage efficiency and accessibility for the analyzer.
- Enables quick recovery and reconstruction of rules by new instances in the event of analyzer issues.
- Redis provides features like data persistence and high availability, contributing to system robustness.

### Cons:
- Implementation and maintenance of a distributed cache may introduce complexity.
- Potential increased resource usage and costs associated with the use of a distributed cache.
- Proper configuration and monitoring of the cache system are essential to ensure its effective operation.
