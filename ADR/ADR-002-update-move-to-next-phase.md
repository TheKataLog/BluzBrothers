## ADR-000: Exclusion of System Update from the First Phase of the Project
### Date:
2024-02-16

### Status:
Proposed

### Context:
In the planning phase of our information system project, we faced the issue of task prioritization and time constraints. Due to limited resources and the necessity to deliver the first version of the product promptly, the project team must choose which functionalities to implement in the initial stage of development. The system update mechanism is one of the functionalities that require special consideration.

### Decision:
We have decided that the system update will not be considered in the first phase of the project. This decision is based on several key considerations:

The complexity of implementing an update mechanism could significantly extend the time required to deliver the first version of the product.
Initial use of the system in a limited scope (pilot) will allow for collecting essential feedback from users without the immediate need for updates.
Focusing on core functionalities and the stability of the system is crucial for the success of the initial project phase.

### Consequences:


#### PROS:
- Reduction in the time needed to deliver the first version of the product.
- Ability to focus on the stability and optimization of core functionalities.
- Decrease in initial project costs.

#### Cons:
- Potential risk of the system becoming quickly outdated without the ability to easily update.
- Limitation in the ability to introduce improvements and new functionalities in response to user feedback during the early phase of use.
- The necessity for significant work in the second phase of the project to implement the update mechanism.
- Deciding to exclude the system update from the first phase of the project is challenging, but it seems to be the best compromise between delivering the product quickly and resource limitations. In subsequent project phases, we will reevaluate this decision and plan the introduction of the update mechanism based on the experiences gathered and feedback from users.
